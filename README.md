Megacubo is an intuitive, multi-language and cross-platform IPTV player with support for history, bookmarks and much more.

You can add as many IPTV lists you want (M3U format) and with Miniplayer mode, you can work or navigate on your PC while watching any broadcast.

Platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android.

Available languages: English, Español, Português, Ελληνικά, Deutsch, Français, Italiano, हिन्दी, Polski, русский, Shqip, 普通话 and Türkçe.

Can you help us by adding [more languages](https://github.com/efoxbr/megacubo/tree/master/www/nodejs-project/lang) or improving current ones?
