Megacubo is an intuitive, free, multi-language and cross-platform IPTV player with support for history, bookmarks, smart recommendations, [hotkeys](https://github.com/EdenwareApps/Megacubo/blob/master/HOTKEYS.md) and much more.

You can add as many IPTV lists you want (supports M3U, Xtream and MAG device lists) and with Miniplayer mode, you can work or navigate while watching any broadcast.

Megacubo can be installed on computers (Windows, Linux or macOS) and its Android version can be installed on smartphones, tablets, TV boxes, Android smart TVs and TV sticks.

Available languages: English, Español, Português, عربي, বাংলা, Deutsch, Ελληνικά, Français, हिन्दी, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, 日本, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ, Polski, русский, Shqip, Kiswahili, తెలుగు, Türkçe, اردو and 普通话.

Can you help us by adding [more languages](https://github.com/EdenwareApps/Megacubo/tree/master/www/nodejs-project/lang) or improving current ones?
