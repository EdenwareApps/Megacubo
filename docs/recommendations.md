## How Content Recommendations Work

Megacubo analyzes:

- Channels you've watched
- Channels you've favorited
- Time spent per channel
- Viewing patterns and preferences

It then suggests similar content in the **Recommended for You** section.

## Continue Watching Feature

Access your viewing history in **Tools** > **Continue Watching**:

- **Recent channels**: Shows recently watched content
- **Improved recommendations**: History is used to enhance content suggestions
- **Quick access**: Resume watching from where you left off
- **Viewing patterns**: Helps the algorithm learn your preferences

## Customizing Your Preferences

1. Go to **Options** > **Behavior** to adjust recommendation settings.
2. Adjust categories like sports, news, movies, etc.
3. Your recommendations will update accordingly.

## Clearing Watch History

To reset recommendations:

1. Go to **Options** > **Advanced** > **Developer options**.
