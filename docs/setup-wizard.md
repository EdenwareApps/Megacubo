# <span style="color: #2e86de;">IPTV Player Initial Setup Wizard</span>

When launching **Megacubo** for the first time, you'll be guided through a simple setup wizard to configure basic preferences.

## Choosing Language

The app detects your system language automatically, but you can change it during setup:

1. Click or select **Change Language**.
2. Choose from the list of available languages.
3. Confirm to restart the app with the new language.

## Adding Your First IPTV List

You'll be prompted to add an M3U playlist. You have two options:

- **Add List Manually**: Enter the URL or path to your M3U file.
- **Use Community Mode**: Load shared lists from other users.

If you don't have a list yet, you can skip this step and return later.

### Sharing Lists in Community Mode

When adding a list, if the app doesn't detect username and password in the URL, it will ask if you want to share the list. Sharing helps other users but may cause access restrictions if your list doesn't allow simultaneous connections. Your list will never be shared without your consent.

> **Note**: For detailed information about Community Mode, see [Community Mode](community-mode.md).

## Performance Settings

Megacubo checks your device's memory and may suggest performance optimizations:

- **Low-end Device Mode**: Disables animations, visual effects and content recommendations for better performance.
- **Network Optimization**: Adjusts buffer size and connection strategy.
- **Memory Management**: Reduces memory usage by loading fewer lists/EPGs simultaneously.

These settings can also be changed later in the **Options** menu.

### Advanced Performance Options

- **Disk Cache**: Adjust cache limit (default: 1GB) in Options > Advanced > Developer options
- **Memory Usage**: Enable "For slow devices" mode to reduce memory consumption
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old cache files are automatically removed

## Completing Setup

After configuring your preferences:

1. **Review your settings** before proceeding
2. **Test a channel** to ensure everything works
3. **Explore the interface** to familiarize yourself with the app

## Post-Setup Options

Once setup is complete, you can:

- **Add more IPTV lists** in the **My Lists** section
- **Customize the interface** in **Options** > **Behavior**
- **Enable additional features** like favorites and recommendations
- **Adjust performance settings** based on your needs
- **Set up search shortcuts** (F3) for quick channel finding
- **Configure themes** in **Tools** > **Themes**

## Troubleshooting Setup Issues

If you encounter problems during setup:

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Verify M3U file format** if adding manually
3. **Try Community Mode** if manual lists fail
4. **Restart the app** if settings don't apply
5. **Check the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md)** for more help
6. **Run megacubo-debug** for detailed logs (Windows/Linux)
