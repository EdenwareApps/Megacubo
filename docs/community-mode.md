## Enabling Community Mode

1. Go to **My Lists** > **Community Mode**.
2. Toggle **Enable Community Mode**.
3. The app will start fetching shared lists from other users.

## How Shared Lists Work

- Users anonymously share their M3U playlists.
- These playlists URLs are made available to others.
- Lists are selected automatically to ensure quality.
- **Important**: Only M3U playlist URLs are shared through an automated system without human moderation. The app does not host, distribute, or verify the content accessed through these URLs.

### Sharing Your Lists

When adding a new IPTV list:

1. If the app doesn't detect username and password in the URL, it will ask if you want to share the list
2. **Benefits**: Helps other users discover new content
3. **Considerations**: May cause access restrictions if your list doesn't allow simultaneous connections
4. You can disable sharing at any time

### List Selection Criteria

Community lists are chosen based on:

- **List size**: Larger lists with more channels are prioritized
- **Content relevance**: Matching your viewing preferences and recommendations
- **Quality metrics**: Some random streams are tested to ensure the list is not offline.

## Content Moderation and Filtering

### Automatic Filtering

- **Adult content**: Automatically filtered unless disabled in settings

### Parental Controls

Set up content filtering in **Options** > **Parental Control**:

1. Create a word blacklist to hide specific content
2. Enable automatic content filtering
3. Customize filtering rules for your preferences

## Benefits of Community Mode

- **Discover new content**: Access channels from around the world
- **Automatic list refresh**: Lists are refreshed regularly
- **Quality control**: Broken links are automatically filtered
- **No setup required**: Just enable and start watching
- **Anonymous sharing**: Your personal information is never shared
- **Content relevance**: Lists are selected based on your preferences
- **URL sharing only**: Only M3U playlist URLs are shared, not content itself

## Privacy and Safety

- All shared lists are anonymous
- No personal information is collected
- You can disable Community Mode at any time
- Report inappropriate content to help maintain quality
- Your viewing history remains private and local

## Limitations and Considerations

### Transmission Reliability

- Some streams may be offline or expired
- Lists may have access restrictions
- Quality varies between different sources

### Access Restrictions

- Some lists may not allow simultaneous connections
- Sharing may cause temporary access issues
- Provider limitations can affect availability

## Troubleshooting Community Mode

### Common Issues

- **No lists available**: Check your internet connection
- **Streams not working**: Try switching transmissions or wait for updates
- **Access denied**: Some lists may have connection limits

### Solutions

1. **Refresh lists**: Restart the app or toggle Community Mode
2. **Switch transmissions**: Use the circular arrows icon
3. **Check settings**: Ensure Community Mode is properly enabled
